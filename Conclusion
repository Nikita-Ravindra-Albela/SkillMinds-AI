## Business Problem

Online learning platforms often struggle with low course completion rates and inconsistent learner engagement. The goal of this project was to identify user behavior patterns and engagement metrics that could inform retention and conversion strategies.

## Analytical Approach

Conducted cohort and funnel analysis on learner activity data (synthetic dataset simulating 10K+ users).

Used SQL for data cleaning and segmentation; Python (Pandas, Matplotlib) for analysis and visualization.

Built an interactive Power BI dashboard to track retention, conversion, and engagement KPIs across cohorts.

## Key Insights

Identified a 30–40% learner drop-off during the first week of course enrollment.

Discovered that users with 5+ weekly sessions had a 2.5x higher completion rate.

Found that engagement spiked when users interacted with community features and peer feedback modules.

## Business Impact (Modeled on Analysis)

Funnel and cohort analysis revealed drop-offs that, if addressed, could improve learner retention by ~15%.

Engagement segmentation indicated that highly active users (15–20 hrs/week) were 3× more likely to convert to paid plans.

Proposed a data-driven tiered pricing model projected to increase premium conversions by ~10–12%.

Designed a dashboard framework that could cut reporting time by 40% for product and growth teams through real-time visibility.
