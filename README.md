# SkillMinds AI Classes
🧩 Project Overview

SkillMinds AI is an AI-driven learning and upskilling platform designed to empower students, professionals, and organizations through personalized learning paths, AI mentorship, and certification-based career advancement.

The platform operates on a freemium-to-paid model, providing users free access to foundational courses and chatbot-based support, while offering paid access to advanced certifications, mentor sessions, and career dashboards.

This project analyzes user engagement behavior, satisfaction, and conversion patterns to uncover the key drivers that influence free-to-paid subscription transitions.

🎯 Project Objectives

Analyze churn drivers among paid and free users.

Explore satisfaction patterns across user segments.

Simulate business recommendations to improve retention and monetization.

🧠 Key Business Questions

What is the overall conversion rate from free to paid users?

Which user segments (student, business, job seeker, etc.) show the highest engagement and growth?

How do AI chatbot interactions correlate with satisfaction and conversion?

What is the churn rate among different countries and plans?

How can the platform increase paid conversions and reduce churn?

🧮 Sample DAX Measures
Total Users = COUNT('User Data'[user_id])

Paid Users = CALCULATE(COUNT('User Data'[user_id]), 'User Data'[subscription_type] = "Paid")

Free Users = CALCULATE(COUNT('User Data'[user_id]), 'User Data'[subscription_type] = "Free")

Churn Rate = DIVIDE(
    CALCULATE(COUNT('User Data'[user_id]), 'User Data'[churn_status] = "Yes"),
    [Total Users]
)

Conversion Rate = DIVIDE(
    CALCULATE(COUNT('User Data'[user_id]), 'User Data'[conversion_flag] = "Yes"),
    CALCULATE(COUNT('User Data'[user_id]), 'User Data'[subscription_type] = "Free")
)

📈 Executive Summary

The SkillMinds AI Conversion Analysis explores the behavioral and engagement patterns of 50,000 simulated users to understand how a freemium learning platform can optimize its growth and monetization strategy.

Key outcomes:

A 14.9% conversion rate from free to paid users highlights a strong engagement foundation.

11.5% churn rate suggests improving onboarding and engagement strategies could retain more users.

Satisfaction score of 7.12 across both free and paid users signals healthy but improvable user experience.

Geographic and segment analysis identifies India, Germany, and Canada as emerging user bases.

AI-driven personalization, targeted pricing, and user retention initiatives could significantly enhance revenue and user lifetime value.

The project demonstrates a complete analytics cycle from data preprocessing and visualization to business storytelling showcasing how data can guide strategic decisions in SaaS and EdTech environments.
